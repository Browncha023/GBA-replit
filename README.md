# GBA-replit
[![Run on Replit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BinBashBanana/deploy-buttons/master/buttons/remade/replit.svg)](https://replit.com/github/Browncha023/GBA-replit)
A lightweight port of my GBA project modified to run on replit (used in the old EndInternetCensorship demo)

I decided to finally upload the files for my modified GBA project used in EndInternetCensorship. It loads the roms directly from github to make the project light enough for replit.
